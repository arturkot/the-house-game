Introduction
------------

I've wanted to create a game since a long time. You know - one of those cool things you'd like try. :) When I started working on this project I had only basic knowledge about JS. Very basic. I didn't even know how to define an array and JS objects and methods were some kind of mystery. Thanks to this game my skills have developed tremendously. I'm still far from calling myself "pro JS dev" but I've got siginficantly closer.

**You can play it [right here](http://the-house.arturkot.pl).** Please mind that:

* it's very, very short,
* it's my first game ever. :)

How does it work?
-----------------

The game is made using **HTML, CSS (Less) and JS (depends strongly on jQuery)**. Every room, roughly speaking, has simple markup in HTML which defines items (such as table, window, etc.) and click areas. CSS is responsible for graphic and JS for all the rest (DOM animations, interactions, saving game state). Since I had some experience with developing and designing websites I decided that HTML would be the right technology to start with.

### A little bit more about scripts:

* `js/audio.js` - all sounds are defined here,
* `js/data.js` - responsible for saving game state,
* `js/dialogue_box.js` - responsible for various popups,
* `js/game.js` - sits on the top of all scripts and uses them to genrate game,
* `js/items.js` - manages items found by a player,
* `js/npcs.js` - non playable charcters,
* `old_browser.js` - fires when not supported browser is detected,
* `js/room.js` - generates rooms, responsible for interaction of the main character wit the game world **the A* (A-Star) algorithm here is by Andrea Giammarchi**,
* `js/scenes.js` - cutscenes are stored here,
* `js/settings.js` - game settings, at the time this file is responsible for reseting the game only :P,
* `js/text_cloud.js` - speech balloons for the main character,
* `js/tooltip.js` - tooltips :),
* `js/utility.js` - super simple tool: I use it to define hit-areas for tha game grid,
* `js/view.js` - generates outside views (when you look throught a window).

It's about time to mention resources (and people behind them) that helped me (A LOT) to create my game.
